2025 was an interesting year in music. Like many fans my music habits are cyclical, and this year I branched into girl pop more than I’d care to admit. I’m sure next year I’ll be more dialed in on country/folk, but this year wasn’t without its high points from my longtime favorites. Let’s go over some of my favorite albums of the year and talk about where they stand among the works of each band/artist. 


## Dollar a Day - Charley Crockett

Good news: an average Charley Crockett album is more than satisfactory and packs a better punch than most anything else you’ll find. Charley occupies a very odd niche in music right now. He has found his most commercial success in a pure country/western sound: inspired by Hank, Marty Robbins, and Willie. I cannot fault him for moving away from the blues (where I think he’s most gifted and I’m guessing his heart truly lies) when he can write and record an album like Dollar a Day in just a couple months while on tour. This stuff is just too easy for him. 

Real talk though. Charley, your overarching thesis is about the corruption of Nashville and the virtue in recording real, honest music. In layman’s terms this means you hate sellouts. So, I wonder, how do you rationalize this track you’re on? You’ve morphed into exactly what listeners want, and you’ve begun giving it to them buffet-style. I wouldn’t bat an eye if you had not repeatedly drilled your antiNashevileness into my skull, but since you have, I’m bound to look into your own motivations. Sorry brother, I’ve loved you long enough to be honest. 

Still, Charley has accomplished something rare, which is that he’s built an entire persona and musical library completely apart from his personal life. Other people and bands aren’t doing this. When I ran into him in the Bozeman airport this Summer (slight flex), the man was outfitted in exactly what you’d see him wearing on one of his album covers - down to the felt Stetson and Dahmer glasses. It’s because he is a creative genius. No, charley is not roping cattle or robbing trains. All he’s doing is creating a motif, and it survives without any inclusion of his personal experiences in his music. He’s decided he’s a cowboy and cast aside any urge to autobiograph. And that’s exactly how I’d summarize Dollar a Day. Your mileage may vary, but our cowboy friend sure is reliable. 

## Foxes in the Snow - Jason Isbell

Jason got divorced. Then he got veneers. And then he began dating a much younger girl. Anyone who’d do differently may cast the first stone. This is his announcement that he is still an undefeated songwriter; he doesn’t need to write from a place of struggle. It’s also his first solo project since Southeastern. Having spent a lot of time with this album, I have decided that it’s a great low-stakes Isbell indulgence with a couple all-timers. Crimson and Clay was one of my five most played songs this year - utterly gut wrenching. Compared to the others on this list, I’d call foxes in the snow the most mature, but I’m unlikely to fire it up in the car with friends. Side note: foxes in the snow is a cool metaphor but probably the worst track. I would have named the album differently. 

## The Price of Admission - Turnpike Troubadors

Turnpike is my favorite band right now. And even I will admit, following up their triumphant return with A Cat in the Rain was baffling. It was borderline juiceless and surely placed our Okies on the hot seat for their follow up. This one delivered. It also revealed what Evan Felker did with his personal time when he wasn’t trying to become William Faulkner for A Cat in the Rain. He spent the rest of his time outside in nature, hunting and fishing with his family, and his fans were pleased to hear about it. Give me On the Red River to teach me about familial alcoholism, and mix in Heaven Passing Through to pull me out of the depression you just caused. TPOA is not a top 3 Turnpike for me, but it’s inspired and I’m ready to call it a success. I still feel hurt that Shooter Jennings wound up producing this in Sturgill Simpson’s place. 

## Lefty - Penny and Sparrow

Saw these boys in concert this year. I think they are gifted but I now don’t think of them as a serious performing band. Still, what an album. Jeopardy, Country, Breakdown, Mattering Ram? How do you write so seriously and perform so unseriously? I deeply connect with these songs and I’m grateful to have a duo remaining at the top of their craft (looking at you, watchhouse). 

## Oneida - Tyler Childers

I wrote about this already. At one point I was ready to call it a masterpiece. Turns out I’ve backed off of it a bit, but I still love what it represents. Here’s Tyler Childers being allowed to do whatever he wants. Sure, he could write another lady may and moan some depressed lyrics to a rattly guitar. But he’s already done that. I say let the boy cook, and Rick Rubin does as well. Hopefully I’ve put this more succinctly than I did last time.

## The Cosmic Selector Vol. 1 - Lord Huron

Solid entry for the band which I recently discovered is not from overseas. I liked it but I should really allow Cade to make the case for this being Huron’s magnum opus because I find that take extremely hot and I’d like it to be published. 

Is Who Laughs Last a guilty pleasure? It’s genuinely my favorite track by itself, but it also works as a scene-setter for the album. 

## Copper Changes Color  - Caamp

Again, we should let Cade discuss this. To me it’s serviceable, but not the strongest Caamp entry. Millions, Waiting Up (For You) and Mistakes all made my rotation, but my real qualm is with the album art. By and By and Lavender days a beautiful art pieces, but Copper Changes Color is a portrait of the band. The boys are aging themselves, I’d say, but what do I know. The topic of album art is a great segway to the next album. 

## Hope We Have Fun - Mt. Joy

WHY? You have the coolest brand, everyone recognizes it, and you could have gotten at least a handful more albums out with the trademark Mt. Joy art style. But when you do decide to zag, you give us a black background with a white cursive title. Sorry for the rant.

This album is worth it for In The Middle if nothing else. Gigi Perez is a great feature and I’d argue she saves the album. I also love Wild and Rotten with Nate Rateliff. But Mt. Joy is one of the best bands right now. They can’t let their best songs be features. They’re good enough to stand on their own and it’s unnecessary to pull a DJ Khaled.


Getting all of my thoughts down, I realize I sound grumpy. I do the same thing with movies. Everyone had fun at F1 except for me. Maybe I’ll turn that around in 2026. Happy New Year, expect to hear more from Cade and me.
